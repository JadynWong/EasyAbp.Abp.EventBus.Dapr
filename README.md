# EasyAbp.Abp.EventBus.Dapr

Dapr `pub/sub` relies on http requests to publish subscription events.  
Publish events can be applied in the console using the `EasyAbp.Abp.EventBus.Dapr.Pub` package only.  
Subscription events must be in the web application using the `EasyAbp.Abp.EventBus.Dapr` package.
